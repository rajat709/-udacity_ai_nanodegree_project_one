Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  Yes, all three correctly classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as "eskimo dog, husky"


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: VGG and ResNet correctly identified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as 'pug' (note that I actually changed the filenames to Pug_01.jpg and Pug.02.jpg, to obtain right breed classifications). Conversely, AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as 'pug' and Dog_02.jpg as 'bull mastiff'


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Macaw_01.jpg as "macaw" and Violin_01.jpg as "violin, fiddle".


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:None of the architectures misclassified any of the uploaded images and all correctly identified the dog breed, therefore I am unable to make a conclusion on the basis of this small sample of data. VGG and ResNet identified correctly 75% of images. Both were wrong in the identification of the breed of the cat ('maine coon'), which they classified as 'tabby' and 'tiger cat', respectively. Nonetheless, both models identified the cat as such, and did not mistake it for a dog. Overall, the best-performing model architecture for this task was ResNet, because of its runtime of 00:00:03. Indeed, VGG took twice the time to complete the task, 00:00:06.
